            </ul>
            While some of the challenges LA faces are unique, many are familiar to high performing cities across the country. Job growth means population growth, but new housing fails to be built anywhere close to fast enough to keep up, in Los
            Angeles this has been happening at a rate of more than 3:1.<a href="https://www.scag.ca.gov/Documents/LosAngeles.pdf" target="_blank"><sup></sup></a> Some residents can afford more expensive homes as a limited supply increases demand,
            but those
            that can’t are pushed away into more precarious living situations and longer commutes.
            <br /><br />
            This change isn’t hidden out of sight, it’s seen in every Tesla parked next to a tent. There are more people on top and more on the bottom and it’s only getting harder to stay in the middle.
            <br /><br />
            These crises have many causes and many symptoms, so most solutions are equally complex and opaque. However, there is one relatively binary change that could be made tomorrow.
            <br /><br />
            LA needs to abolish Parking Minimums.
            <br /><br />
            Now parking legislation might seem tangential at best to these issues, but in more ways than one it defines them. Parking is inseparable from housing and transportation, a detrimental cause and effect shaping land use, climate, and daily habits.

            bedroom apartment, and 2
            parking spaces for a 2 bedroom apartment. This means building a single 400 sq ft unit will actually require more than 715 sq ft of total space.
            <br /><br />
            For commercial buildings, it’s common to see a parking space required for every 100-200 sq ft. Meaning that parking is built at an almost 2:1 ratio to actual retail space, marginalizing the place that actually creates value and
            prioritizing temporary car storage. This inefficiency is carried into rent, groceries, meals, and overall raises the floor for cost of living.

              This forces people into driving. Parking requirements increase the density of cars but reduce the density of people. It also puts pressure on businesses by taking up useful real estate and replacing it with car storage.

                improvements to the land. Parking has low value, so while it consumes a large amount of space, it’s captured value is low, and it’s geographical burden on the city is high. Property tax in general is a rats nest, California
                specifically handles it notoriously poorly.<a href="#21"><sup></sup></a>

                Parking eats away at our cities from the inside. Taking away precious space and replacing it with what Marc Augé calls “Non Places”. What makes a city or a neighborhood is where people spend time: parks, schools, grocery stores,
                hospitals, restaurants, museums, offices. These are destinations, these are places. Los Angeles spends too much money separating where people want to go with structures valued by how much emptiness they contain.

            We’ve established the geometric price of parking. It’s the cost of space, and thus considering the housing crisis, it’s the cost of residential units not built.
            <br /><br />
            At 300 sq ft, a one bedroom apartment can effectively fit in a single parking space, and a 500 sq ft two bedroom apartment fits in two parking spaces comfortably. Removing parking minimums results in an estimated 20% to 33% increase in
            the
            number of potential units in a residential building.<a href=" http://www.reconnectingamerica.org/assets/Uploads/finalreporttcrp128.pdf " target="_blank"><sup></sup></a>

              While the spatial cost is obvious and frustrating, the fiscal cost is possibly more important. Opportunity for housing doesn’t equal built housing. Someone needs to pay for new construction, and requiring parking spaces come at a

              <br /><br />
              Building a single underground space in Los Angeles comes out to an estimated $35,000, while a single aboveground space cost $27,000.<a href="http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/HighCost.pdf " target="_blank"><sup></sup></a> These costs come from
              expensive vertical dead-load support and even pricier

              put a much larger percent of unit cost towards parking than a more expensive high-end unit.

                All told, requiring parking mean fewer units getting built, and those that are built are more expensive. A single parking space adds an estimated 12.5% to monthly rent, while a second parking space doubles that to 25%.<a href="http://www.vtpi.org/park-hou.pdf "

          However, that’s only accounting for new residential buildings.

          <h3>05. THE FALLACY OF TRAFFIC</h3>
          <h2>
            In Los Angeles traffic is estimated to cost some $9 billion in lost economic output each year. One of the most cited opposition to new housing, especially dense, and especially in LA, is traffic getting worse. We’ve simultaneously
            convinced ourselves it is both a permanent installation in city life and simultaneously out-buildable via new road infrastructure. Many proposed “traffic solutions” actively hamper efforts to improve the quality of living and solve
            traffic
            itself. Infamously Los Angeles recently spent $1.6 billion adding lanes to the 405 freeway bottleneck through Sepulveda Pass to only make traffic worse.<a href=" https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/us/los-angeles-drivers-on-the-405-ask-was-1-6-billion-worth-it.html"

            This is a concept called induced demand.
            <br /><br />
            What you get is what you build. New roads just create more incentive for driving. It's been well<a href="http://www.ademloos.be/sites/default/files/meccano_docs/The_Fundamental_Law_of_Road_Congestion_Evidence_from_US_Cities.pdf " target="_blank"><sup></sup></a>

            If we only build for traffic then traffic will be a constant. We need to use current road space in a more efficient manner. Cars don't just take up an enormous amount of space parked, but moving as well. The City of Los Angeles has the
            highest number of Lane miles per 1,000 persons in the US. It also has the highest total highest Vehicle Miles Driven per square mile out of any major US city.<a href="https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt485983zw/qt485983zw.pdf

              Los Angeles mode share needs to rapidly abandon it’s dependance on cars. Transit, walkability, and micro-mobility aren’t just the future of a more efficient and safer Los Angeles, but necessary for any attempt in reducing its carbon
              footprint.
              <br /><br />
              An electric scooter, for example, cost 1/70th the cheapest Tesla, can travel more than 20 times the distance on the same kWh charge, and takes up 1/15th the space when parked.<a href=" https://www.wired.com/story/e-scooter-micromobility-infographics-cost-emissions/ "

              Healthy urban environments sit at one end of a seesaw. Car centric infrastructure, including parking, sit on the other. These are combative ideals, oil and water; they define each other but cannot coexist.

            Even the most automobile centered techno-future will have less parking. The double threat of autonomous vehicles and rideshare services make a rapid collapse in car ownership a sure prediction. A system with fewer cars working more hours
            is far more efficient than the current model of “everyone spends lots of money on a personal vehicle that’s parked 95% of the day.” The future isn’t parked, it’s constantly moving.
            <br /><br />
            It's important to understand that the answers to many of our cities largest problems don't involve glamorous solutions. Dense housing existed thousands of years before the earliest written language. London was building subways in the
            1800s. In many cases, building safer pedestrian or cycling infrastructure simply requires painting different lines on the road and installing cheap bollards.
            <br /><br />
            Cities are organisms that grow and change of their own accord, but we can't look past the fact that every part of a city is built by design. Every parcel in LA is zoned for certain uses, densities, and heights. There exists an archive in
            LADOTs headquarters of the exact dimensions of every roadway in the City of Los Angeles. People choose what cities look like and how they function, it's not only our responsibility, but also entirely in our power to change city design to
            be better.
            <br /><br />
            Street parking can be converted into micro-mobility lanes, bus lanes, expanded sidewalks, parklets, and bike/scooter corrals. Let’s not only move more people, but also make our streets enjoyable places to be in instead of the fastest
            possible route through. If it isn’t comfortable for children and the elderly then we are failing.
            <br /><br />
            Surface lots can be converted into housing, but also community amenities. Lets build more playgrounds and schools and parks. Let's plant more trees to capture carbon, absorb toxins out of the air, and reduce urban heat island effects.
            <br /><br />
            Housing, transportation, and the environment, are all large and complicated problems. Parking is simple, we have more than Los Angeles will ever need. There’s absolutely no reason to be building more.
            <br /><br />
            Los Angeles has the space, it just needs right priorities.

            The City of Los Angeles Transit Oriented Communities guidelines passed in 2018<a href="https://planning.lacity.org/ordinances/docs/toc/TOCGuidelines.pdf " target="_blank"><sup></sup></a> allows developers to build higher, more
            affordably, and with less parking near rail stations and frequent busses. However only the least common Tier allows units to be built without any parking, and still sets the commercial parking minimum to 40%. All told, only some 2.5
            square miles of Los Angeles are eligible for construction with no new residential parking.
            <br /><br />
            Santa Monica recently passed what might be the region's most progressive Parking Regulation.<a href=" http://www.qcode.us/codes/santamonica/view.php?cite=_9.28.060&confidence=5" target="_blank"><sup></sup></a> But even this only affects
            a
            small downtown core area and still requires half a parking space per multi-family unit.
            <br /><br />
            Parking legislation should be focused on two things; what will get the most housing built the quickest, and what will best prioritize low-carbon solutions. Los Angeles needs something similar to the following:
            <ol>
            <li>No universal parking minimums. Developers choose how much parking the market requires.</li>
            <li>Parking Maximums in Transit Oriented Communities.</li>
            <li>All new parking garages must be built future-proof, with flat floors and high enough ceilings to allow future conversion into office, studio, or living space.  </li>
            <li>25% of parking spaces must include EV charging, with the rest install ready.</li>

          To calculate housing opportunity the above acreage estimations were multiplied by different housing densities. 50 units per acre seemed a medium amount of density suitable for most locations, with dense cores needing something closer to
          100+
          an acre and current single family neighborhoods needing sub 30 an acre.

          Although the total surface area we sacrifice to parking could be even higher, and the density of buildings built above even taller; 114,814 acres at 5,740,700 potential housing units is more than enough to prove the absurdity of current
          parking legislation in Los Angeles County.

        <h2 id="21"><a href="#back21"><img class="arrow" src="img/bigarrow.png" /></a>21. There is an additional conversation to be had about California's regressive Prop 13 which capped property tax increase at 2% per year of its most recent
          purchase or improvement value assessment. This incentivises property
          owners to sit on land because improving property will not only add taxable value but also bump them from outdated prices to market value. It also means the deficit in property tax revenue has been replaced by developer impact fees which
          makes new housing more expensive to build. California has impact fees 3 times the national average. The California Legislative Analyst's Office page sums up the hidden costs of Prop 13 nicely<a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2016/3497/common-claims-prop13-091916.pdf" target="_blank"><sup></sup></a></h2>
